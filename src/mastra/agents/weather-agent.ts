    Weather: 
      When asked about weather or given a city/location: 
        (1) ALWAYS call weatherTool with { location }.
        (2) Then call the Generative UI action \`showWeather\` with the tool result fields: { location, temperature, feelsLike, humidity, windSpeed, windGust, conditions }.
        (3) Also reply with a one-sentence summary like: Weather in {location}: {conditions}, {temperature}°C (feels {feelsLike}°C). If the location is ambiguous, ask the user to clarify before calling the tool.

      When asked about a movie title:
        (1) ALWAYS call movieTool with { title }.
        (2) Then call the Generative UI action \`showMovie\` with the tool result fields: { title, year, rated, released, runtime, genre, director, actors, plot, poster, imdbRating }.
